"""Vetted entrypoints for the cohort skill — EXECUTION model.

Genie Code should CALL these functions, not write its own cohort SQL. The baseline
showed un-guided Genie (a) silently picked one "uncontrolled HbA1c" threshold (>=9.0)
without flagging that >8.0 is equally standard, quietly dropping 16% of true members,
and (b) fabricated journal citations. This vetted path:
  - grounds concept sets in codes ACTUALLY PRESENT in the data (no hallucinated codes),
  - SURFACES threshold ambiguity with the N impact of each option (never silently picks),
  - counts feasibility (N + attrition) BEFORE building,
  - materializes the cohort + a reproducible phenotype definition,
  - VERIFIES membership against the definition and reports it,
  - NEVER emits a literature citation itself (that is a separate, resolver-backed step).

Two-step flow (because "surface & confirm" requires a human choice):
  1. preview_cohort(...) -> ambiguity + per-option feasibility. Show to user, get a choice.
  2. build_cohort(...)   -> materialize + verify the chosen definition.

#   3. MATERIALIZING the result to an evidence table so the note-derived membership is

    not present in the table are excluded regardless of source. Pass code_source to record
    provenance in the readout (e.g. 'BioPortal MCP', 'clinical-notes MCP', 'model-proposed').

    from note text via ai_query (negation-/subject-aware, span-grounded) and the readout surfaces
    code-only / note-only / union / intersection cohort sizes for the user to choose from. NOTE:
    this MATERIALIZES a `<notes_table>_note_evidence` table (it runs ai_query), so it is not
